\subsection{\textit{Underwater Image Enhancement via Medium
        Transmission-Guided Multi-Color Space Embedding\cite{Li_2021}}}

\paragraph{Abstract:}
This paper proposes a multi-color space encoder network that incorporates characteristics of differeent color spaces into a unified structure. It uses an attention mechanism to find discriminative features and adaptively highlights them. The decoder network is guided by phisical models to find quality degraded areas

\paragraph{Methodology:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-Color Space Encoder
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Transforms input into RGB, HSV, and Lab color spaces
              \item Each color space is passed through a Residual Enhancement Module that has convolution laters with Leaky ReLU activation and Pixel-wise addition with the original image
              \item Pixel wise addition prevents vanishing gradients and preserves low level details
          \end{itemize}

    \item Medium Transmission Based Decoder
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Use a reverse medium transmission map as an attention mask
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Medium transmission T(x) represents how much light from the scene at pixel x reaches the camera after being attenuated and scattered in water.
                        \item It can be measured mathematically based on scene radiance and background light
                        \item Reverse Medium Transformation (RMT) is measured as RMT(x) = 1-T(x) and represents how much degradation is caused in the image due to water
                    \end{itemize}
              \item Combine encoder features with the RMT map to emphasize degraded areas
              \item Reconstruct output via resifual enhancement and upsampling layers
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Combines Physical and Data-driven Approaches} \\
          Uses medium transmission (from physical modelling) within a deep learning pipeline

    \item \textbf{Multi-Color Space Feature Learning} \\
          Capture richer information by processing data across different color spaces
    
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanism based on Medium Transmission} \\
          Enhance important features based on degradation

    \item \textbf{Superior Quantitative Metrics} \\
          Outperforms baselines in PSNR,MSE, UIQM, and UCIQE.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Disadvantages}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dependence on Medium Transmission Estimation} \\
          Inaccurate transmission maps can degrade performance in severly degraded regions

    \item \textbf{Computational Complexity} \\
          Multi-color space embedding and attention modules increase computational costs and are not suitable for real time applications

    \item \textbf{Lighting Conditions} \\
          Performance is limited in images with very low lightin

    \item \textbf{Lack of Real Ground Truth for Transmission Maps} \\
          Medium transmission map is estimated based on heuristics and may not capture true degradation levels
\end{itemize}
